# Logseq Sync

Note: This project/repo is brand new, nothing works yet.

An attempt at an open-source version of the [Logseq Sync](https://blog.logseq.com/how-to-setup-and-use-logseq-sync/) service, intended for individual, self-hosted use.

## Associated Changes to Logseq

Being able to connect to a self-hosted sync server requires some changes to Logseq as well, namely to specify where your sync server can be accessed. Those changes are in a rough, non-functional state here: https://github.com/logseq/logseq/compare/master...bcspragu:logseq:brandon/settings-hack
